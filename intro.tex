\section{Introduction}
Light clients on the Solana blockchain require a way to verify the status of a transaction 
without having to manually download the ledger and replay the transactions or rely on 
trusted RPCs for transaction confirmation. RPCs already have access to ledger and hence 
they can replay any transactions without any additional efforts. This is the current state 
of affairs and there's no other way for a light client to locally verify the execution 
of a particular transaction of interest. We propose a better way to cryptographically
verify the confirmation status of a transaction by introducing transaction receipts 
and a merkle tree based commitment scheme for these receipts to be constructed per slot.
A transaction receipt is a data structure representing the execution of a transaction. 
More specifically it contains the signature and the execution status of the transaction. 
We construct a binary merkle tree and with the receipts as leaves. The leaves and the 
intermediate nodes are prefixed to differentiate between them. In the further sections 
we produce a formal proof of security of the commitment scheme along with addressing 
the correctness, soundness and compactness of the scheme.
