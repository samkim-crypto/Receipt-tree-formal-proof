# Receipt-tree-formal-proof

Receipt tree is a binary merkle tree of transaction receipts as described in [SIMD](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/64). In this repository we provide a formal proof of 
security against merkle tree length extension attacks and malleability by formalizing the commitment scheme 
and adding preventive measures against the mentioned attacks.
